# Main Dialogue 
Wise Old Man:Hmm...
Sierra:? 
Wise Old Man:I sense a great power emanating from you... 
Wise Old Man:It's a good thing too because you're going to need it.
Sierra:Why is that? 
Wise Old Man:Because you're about to embark on a dangerous journey. If you keep your wits about you and your will is strong, you might just make it back. 
Wise Old Man:Good Luck! 
Sierra:Erm... Thanks.
