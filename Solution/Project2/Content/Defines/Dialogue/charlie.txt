Charlie:What was all that Ruckus? Is Dravin no more?! Who are you!?
Sierra:You won't have to worry about him anymore. A 'thank you for rescuing me' would be nice before you start interrogating me.
Charlie:1000 apologies my lady. Thank you ever so much for saving me. 
Sierra:That's more like it. 
Charlie:Thanks to you I can now go back to ruling the kingdom and restore prosperity to the land.
